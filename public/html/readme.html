<h3>Idea</h3>

Find Me is a web application built for all wi-fi devices that facilitates meet-ups. Not only does it give users meeting place suggestions, it also shows real-time trajectory maps, calculates ETAs, gives access to a built-in chat, and incorporates fun geolocation games for users that are on-the-go. Find Me can also be used on the desktop to ensure that your loved ones get to where they need to go safely and with that grocery list on hand! Find Me is perfect for your next impromptu meeting.
